"""
Group-aware n-fold evaluation.

Attelo uses a variant of n-fold evaluation, where we (still)
randomly partition the dataset into a set of folds of roughly even
size, but respecting the additional constraint that any two data
entries belonging in the same "group" (determined by a single
distiguished feature, eg. the document id, the dialogue id, etc)
are always in the same fold. Note that this makes it a bit harder
to have perfectly evenly sized folds.
